good. now we stop circling and crystallize a system.

what follows is not advice. it’s a writing operating system you can reuse across domains, scales, and audiences. it’s deliberately exhaustive. you will skip most of it most of the time. that’s the point.

⸻

i. the universal writing loop (pre-writing, not prose)

before structure, before sentences, before audience:
you do this off-page or in rough notes.

phase 0: force reality

answer, brutally:
	•	what actually happened?
	•	where did i spend time?
	•	where was i confused?
	•	where was i wrong longer than i should’ve been?
	•	what did i change my mind about?

if you can’t answer these, you are not done living with the problem.

⸻

ii. the core structural atoms (pick 3–6 per piece)

these are lego bricks, not a single rigid outline. the best essays reuse the same atoms in different orders.

1. naive belief / default assumption

“i used to think …”
“the standard story is …”

required for:
	•	tutorials
	•	conceptual essays
	•	postmortems

⸻

2. vice / failure mode / illusion

“this belief fails because …”
“what people miss is …”

this is where seriousness enters. name the sin:
	•	cleverness
	•	over-generalization
	•	premature abstraction
	•	cargo culting
	•	metric worship
	•	vibes

⸻

3. pressure applied

how the belief met reality:
	•	scale
	•	time
	•	users
	•	entropy
	•	economics
	•	human behavior
	•	your own limitations

no pressure = no learning.

⸻

4. crack / surprise

the epistemic hinge.
	•	what didn’t work even though it should have?
	•	what worked even though it shouldn’t have?
	•	what result forced you to update?

this is the heart. if nothing surprised you, don’t publish.

⸻

5. decision points (A vs B)

explicit forks:
	•	what were the live options?
	•	what did each optimize for?
	•	why was one tempting but wrong?

this is where experts lean in.

⸻

6. before → after → principle

canonical teaching move:
	•	before: concrete mess
	•	after: concrete improvement
	•	principle: transferable rule (with scope!)

never state a principle naked. earn it.

⸻

7. small catalog of moves

a list that names a space:
	•	“3 smells that told me the model was wrong”
	•	“5 ways this abstraction leaks”
	•	“when you should not use this tool”

lists are allowed. vagueness is not.

⸻

8. new frame / new language

what can you now say that you couldn’t before?
	•	a distinction
	•	a taxonomy
	•	a mental model
	•	a renamed problem

this is where essays become memorable.

⸻

9. changelog spine (time made visible)

what changed, in order:
	•	beliefs
	•	architecture
	•	scope
	•	constraints

even non-technical essays benefit from a time axis.

⸻

10. implications beyond the project

generalization:
	•	“this pattern shows up whenever …”
	•	“this is not about X, it’s about Y”

your project is the price of admission, not the point.

⸻

11. explicit limits

state:
	•	what you didn’t test
	•	where this breaks
	•	what would change your mind

this is credibility, not weakness.

⸻

12. advice to a smarter-you-earlier

forces humility + precision:

“if you’re sharp but early, here’s what will still trip you.”

⸻

iii. the question bank (this is the real engine)

you don’t answer all of these.
you interrogate yourself until something sharp falls out.

a. reality & epistemics
	•	what do i know vs believe vs prefer?
	•	what evidence would falsify my current view?
	•	what data did i ignore at first?
	•	what was i overconfident about?

b. uncertainty & change
	•	where did my confidence increase?
	•	where did it collapse?
	•	what belief lasted the longest before breaking?
	•	what still feels unresolved?

c. decisions & tradeoffs
	•	what constraints were binding?
	•	what did optimizing for X destroy?
	•	what was the “obviously correct” choice that wasn’t?
	•	what did i choose not to do, and why?

d. taste & judgement
	•	what do i now consider “bad practice” that i didn’t before?
	•	what do i now consider “elegant”?
	•	where do i disagree with common wisdom?

e. pedagogy
	•	what would novices misunderstand here?
	•	what do experts assume silently?
	•	where is the cliff edge people fall off?

f. generalization
	•	what other domains does this map onto?
	•	what pattern is invariant under surface differences?
	•	what would break if scale / incentives / humans changed?

g. interiority (montaigne / dfw axis)
	•	what did it feel like to be stuck here?
	•	what false lead was emotionally convincing?
	•	where did boredom, fear, or impatience affect decisions?

h. moral seriousness
	•	who gets hurt if this is done badly?
	•	what kind of failure is unacceptable?
	•	what responsibility did i have that i didn’t at first see?

i. after-action
	•	what would i do first if restarting?
	•	what would i never do again?
	•	what did this cost me (time, attention, opportunity)?

⸻

iv. formats (same atoms, different emphasis)

1. technical blog post

bias toward:
	•	decision points
	•	before/after → principle
	•	catalogs of moves
	•	failure modes
	•	constraints

tone: precise, testable, slightly judgmental.

⸻

2. essay (conceptual / cross-domain)

bias toward:
	•	naive belief → crack → new frame
	•	language creation
	•	generalization
	•	taste and judgement

tone: serious, exploratory, controlled.

⸻

3. work log / notebook

bias toward:
	•	time
	•	artifacts
	•	uncertainty
	•	hypotheses + refutations
	•	raw notes + brief synthesis

tone: factual, incomplete, honest.

⸻

4. daily journal (private or semi-public)

bias toward:
	•	interiority
	•	confusion
	•	tiny observations
	•	cross-links

this feeds everything else. don’t skip it.

⸻

v. invariants (if you violate these, stop)
	•	never write without a claim
	•	never hide uncertainty
	•	never generalize without a concrete base
	•	never explain instead of thinking
	•	never optimize for “impressive”
	•	never publish before something changed in you

⸻

vi. the final forcing function

before you write the first paragraph, finish this sentence:

“this piece exists because i no longer believe ___, and i want to explain why.”

if you can’t fill that in cleanly, you don’t yet have an essay.
you have material. go live with it longer.
